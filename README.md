> 1. Favor embedding unless there's a compelling reason not to.
> 2. If you need to access an object on its own, don't embed it.
> 3. Consider one-to-few vs one-to-many vs one-to-squillions. Don't embed if you have high-cardinality arrays.
> 4. Don't be afraid of application-level joins; if you index correctly and use the projection specifier, it'll be fine.
> 5. Only denormalize when the read-to-write ratio is high. Don't denormalize infrequently read, but often updated data.
> 6. Structure your data to match the ways your application queries and updates it.

* [Shape Up: Stop Running in Circles and Ship Work that Matters](https://basecamp.com/shapeup)

>
> Whether you’re a founder, CTO, product manager, designer, or developer, you’re probably here because of some common challenges that all software companies have to face.
>
> As software teams start to grow, some common struggles appear:
> * Team members feel like their projects are never-ending.
> * Product managers can’t find time to think strategically about the product.
> * Founders ask themselves: “Why can’t we get features out the door like we used to in the early days?”
>
> We saw these challenges first-hand at Basecamp as we grew from four people to over fifty. Through years of trial and error — and some contrarian thinking — we solved these problems. For over fifteen years we’ve consistently shipped new software at a high-level of quality while maintaining a sense of calm and order.
