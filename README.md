>
> Whether you’re a founder, CTO, product manager, designer, or developer, you’re probably here because of some common challenges that all software companies have to face.
>
> As software teams start to grow, some common struggles appear:
> * Team members feel like their projects are never-ending.
> * Product managers can’t find time to think strategically about the product.
> * Founders ask themselves: “Why can’t we get features out the door like we used to in the early days?”
>
> We saw these challenges first-hand at Basecamp as we grew from four people to over fifty. Through years of trial and error — and some contrarian thinking — we solved these problems. For over fifteen years we’ve consistently shipped new software at a high-level of quality while maintaining a sense of calm and order.

> Recently more and more friends and peers have asked us how we do it. This book is a comprehensive answer.
