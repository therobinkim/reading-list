* [Shape Up: Stop Running in Circles and Ship Work that Matters](https://basecamp.com/shapeup)
> This book is a guide to how we do product development at Basecamp. It’s also a toolbox full of techniques that you can apply in your own way to your own process.
>
> Whether you’re a founder, CTO, product manager, designer, or developer, you’re probably here because of some common challenges that all software companies have to face.
>
> As software teams start to grow, some common struggles appear:
> * Team members feel like their projects are never-ending.
> * Product managers can’t find time to think strategically about the product.
> * Founders ask themselves: “Why can’t we get features out the door like we used to in the early days?”
>
> We saw these challenges first-hand at Basecamp as we grew from four people to over fifty. Through years of trial and error — and some contrarian thinking — we solved these problems. For over fifteen years we’ve consistently shipped new software at a high-level of quality while maintaining a sense of calm and order.
>
> Recently more and more friends and peers have asked us how we do it. This book is a comprehensive answer.

* [Atomic Design](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/) by Brad Frost
> _Atomic Design_ details all that goes into creating and maintaining robust design systems, allowing you to roll out higher quality, more consistent UIs faster than ever before. This book introduces a methodology for thinking of our UIs as thoughtful hierarchies, discusses the qualities of effective pattern libraries, and showcases techniques to transform your team's design and development workflow.

* [Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code] by Martin Fowler
> This book describes the process of refactoring and spends most of its time explaining how to do the various refactorings - the behavior preserving transformations. The book opens with a simple example that describes the whole process. There are then some introductory chapters that discuss broader issues around refactoring, the “code smells” that suggest refactoring, and the role of testing.
> The bulk of the book is around seventy refactorings described in detail: the motivation for doing them, mechanics of how to do them safely and a simple example.
